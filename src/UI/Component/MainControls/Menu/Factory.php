	 *     The slate is a page-area within the sidebar; it acts like an enhanced
	 *     fly-out menu for sidebar-entries.
	 *     The contents of a slate can vary heavily: A search form, the repository tree,
	 *     contextual help, further navigation via buttons, etc.
	 *     However, tools within the slate should not modify the systems data
	 *     in any way - it is for navigation only.
	 *
	 *   composition: >
	 *     The slate can hold a large variety of components. These can be (further)
	 *     navigational entries, text and images or combinations of those.
	 *
	 *   effect: >
	 *     When triggered, the slate opens on the right hand of the sidebar,
	 *     between bar and content, thus "pushing" the content to the right.
	 *     The slate's height equals that of the sidebar; also, its position
	 *     will remain static when the page is scrolled.
	 *
	 *     The slate will allways have a "close"-button at its bottom.
	 *
	 *     When content-length exceeds the slate's height, the area above the
	 *     close button will start scrolling vertically with a scrollbar on the right.
	 *
	 * rules:
	 *   usage:
	 *     1: There MUST be only one slate visible at the same time.
	 *     2: Elements in the slate MUST NOT modify content.
	 *
	 *   accessibility:
	 *     1: The slate MUST be closeable by only using the keyboard
	 *     2: >
	 *        Actions or navigational elements offered inside a slate
	 *        MUST be accessible by only using the keyboard
